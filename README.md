# Welcome to Atlas

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/urbanetic/atlas.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/urbanetic/atlas)

Atlas is a JavaScript library that provides a high-level API for 3D geospatial rendering. The Atlas
API makes it easy to incorporate modern rendering technologies in Web applications, supporting the
next generation of GIS tools.

## Getting Started

The default implementation of Atlas, [Atlas-Cesium][atlas-cesium], uses the HTML5 Cesium rendering
library. As a result, getting started with Atlas is as simple as including some JavaScript into
your Web app. [Check out the documentation][docs] for more information.

## Demos

Atlas has been used in a variety of applications, including:

* [UrbanViewer](http://aurin.org.au/projects/lens-sub-projects/integrated-design-infrastructure-for-australian-cities/)
* [ENVISION Scenario Planner (ESP)](http://aurin.org.au/projects/lens-sub-projects/esp/)
* [VizUrban](http://www.vizurban.info/)
* [Urbanetic Fabric](http://www.urbanetic.net/)

## Contact

Atlas is developed by the team at [Urbanetic][urbanetic] for the [Australian Urban Research
Infrastructure Network][aurin] (AURIN). If you're interested in using Atlas in your own project, let

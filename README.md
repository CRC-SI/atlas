# Welcome to Atlas

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/urbanetic/atlas.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/urbanetic/atlas)

Atlas is a JavaScript library that provides a high-level API for 3D geospatial rendering. The Atlas
API makes it easy to incorporate modern rendering technologies in Web applications, supporting the
next generation of GIS tools.

See [**http://www.atlasjs.org/**](http://www.atlasjs.org/) for more details, and the
[**JSDocs**][jsdocs] for the technical documentation of the code.

Atlas is developed by the [Urbanetic][urbanetic] team, with support from the [Australian Urban
Research Infrastructure Network][aurin] (AURIN). If you're interested in using Atlas in your own

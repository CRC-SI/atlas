# Welcome to Atlas

Atlas is a JavaScript library that provides a high-level API for 3D geospatial rendering. The Atlas
API makes it easy to incorporate modern rendering technologies in Web applications, supporting the
next generation of GIS tools.

## Getting Started

The default implementation of Atlas, `Atlas-Cesium`, uses the HTML5 Cesium rendering library. As a
result, getting started with Atlas is as simple as including some JavaScript into your Web app. See
[Getting Started](getting_started.md) for more information.
